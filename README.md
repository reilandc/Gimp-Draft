# Gimp-Draft
I have started creating my flyer on GIMP and I have had many struggles overall. I think the layers were the most confusting part, mostly because you always had to make sure you had to select the existing layer to modify it. 
However, now that I have more of a handle on the program, I like how clean the organization of an image can be. For example, layers can be spaced out evenly without worrying how it will affect the location or sizes of the other images, which I always found as a problem in word.
I just figured out how to change fonts and sizes of the text, but I am still unsure how to change the color of certain words since it won't let me highlight them.
