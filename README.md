# Gimp-Draft
I have started creating my flyer on GIMP and I have had many struggles overall. I think the layers were the most confusting part, mostly because you always had to make sure you had to select the existing layer to modify it. 
However, now that I have more of a handle on the program, I like how clean the organization of an image can be. For example, layers can be spaced out evenly without worrying how it will affect the location or sizes of the other images, which I always found as a problem in word.
I just figured out how to change fonts and sizes of the text, but I am still unsure how to change the color of certain words since it won't let me highlight them.

I am unsure how to add a thread in a repository since I've been adding them wrong, but here is my attempt at it.
I handed in a draft of my flyer last Thursday and I received a lot of good feedback from it. It can be find in the latest file "Gimp Flyer.png" that I have attached to this repository.
I was given the suggestion to remove the white color of the seal, change the color of the font, change the background, add a drop shadow, and have a header.
I started making those changes by adding in a different background that was more eyecatching and relatable for the event. I chose Phipps Conservatory because it's an organization that could be at the event and because it is a well-known sustainable company in Pittsburgh.
I also changed the font so it would be easier to read and I added a drop shadow. I have added that in this repository as well, under "Gimp Flyer 2.png"

I have completed the front and back of my flyer, which I will attach here. I chose images that thought would help make the text pop and also match the color scheme. The back of the flyer is simple and just has a list of restaurants and businesses in Pittsburgh.
